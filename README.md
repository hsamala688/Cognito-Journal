# Cognito-Journal
Designed to help clinicians and caregivers measure cognitive decline in older patients by analyzing language patterns, journaling frequencies, behavior, and sentiment over time.  The system uses NLP and other behavioral metrics to detect subtle cognitive changes, supporting early intervention and continuous assessment.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals

- Provide a simple, accessible journaling experience for older adults
- Passively assess cognitive function through language and behavioral patterns
- Provide clinicians/caregivers with clear, interpretable reports

### Secondary Goals

- Build trust with users through transparent data handling and privacy controls
- Create a long-term dataset for personalized baselines

## 3. User Personas

### 1. Older Adult/Patient

- Age 60 - 90
- Varies in technology familiarity
- May have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or be cognitively healthy
- Needs simple UI, low cognitive load, consistency

### 2. Clinician

- Geriatrician, Neurologist, Psychiatrist, or Primary Care Physician
- Uses the journal reports to complement traditional cognitive assessments

### 3. Caregiver / Family Member

- Wants ongoing insight into cognitive changes without overwhelming detail
